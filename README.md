## Introduction

Welcome to the Beginner's Hands-On Guide to TypeScript! Whether you're new to programming or coming from JavaScript, TypeScript offers powerful features to enhance your development experience. This guide aims to take you from the basics to advanced concepts through practical examples and exercises.

## Getting Started

To get started with TypeScript, follow these steps:

1. **Install TypeScript**: [How to install TypeScript using npm](./install.md).
2. **Set Up Your Environment**: [Visual Studio Code](./install.md).
